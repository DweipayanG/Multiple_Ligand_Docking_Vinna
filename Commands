#STEPS FOR MULTIPLE LIGANDS DOCKING 

# First you need to perform docking in UCSF-Chimera, with any one ligand, once this is done, you can use the output "docking.receptor.pdbqt" file for following steps.  

#Place the docking.receptor.pdbqt or file having the name like "xxxx.receptor.pdbqt" in to a new folder (working directory), note: this file will be generated previously while performing docking in UCSF-Chimera. 

# rename this file as simply "receptor.pdbqt"

# place the files "conf.txt" and pearl script "Vina_linux.pl" in the working directory (You will find this files from github)

# At this point you will have following files in the working directory: (1) receptor.pdbqt, (2)conf.txt, (3)Vina_linux.pl and (4) ligand multiple files or single file with multiple ligands in sdf format.

# open and edit "conf.txt" to enter the position coordinates for X, Y and Z previously noted down while making docking grid in UCSF-Chimera and also entetr the size of the grid box.   

 
# If you have single sdf file with multiple ligands here and run following command, and if you have multiple ligands seperately in sdf format in working folder skip this step, 

obabel -isdf 100.sdf -osdf -O *.sdf --split 

# Minimization of ligands 

obminimize

obminimize -ff MMFF94 -n 1000 *.sdf

#convert ligands in sdf to pdbqt format 

obabel -isdf *.sdf -opdbqt -O*.pdbqt 
#Once this step is done, delet the sdf files of ligands from the working folder. 

# Make ligand text file for info. 
ls > ligand.txt 

# Open ligand.txt and delet all other lines other than ligand names. 

# Run the perl script for docking, here you should have "receptor.pdbqt" file from chimera or anwhere which is optimized and minimized. 

perl Vina_linux.pl
  ligand.txt 

# To prepare result table 

tail -n11 *.log>results.txt  

# prepare protein ligand complex in chimera, for this open naked protein in CCSF Chimera, then open the output pdbqt file of ligand of your wish/need from Tools>Structure/Binding Analysis > ViewDock
# Save the appropriate pose using File > Save PDB > input file name , choose protein and pose of choice by pressing ctrl select> choose "a single file" under  "Save multiple models in" and lastly press Save.
